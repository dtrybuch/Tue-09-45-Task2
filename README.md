# I learned during this class some things such as:
 - It is recommended to use gitignore if I want to be assure that files which are not needed would not be pushed into repository.
 - How to use dictionary in python to hold data and how to do nested dictionary.
 - We do not should use static attributes in classes.
 - We cannot forget about @absractmethod attribute in abtsract method.
 - We should not use external library in our classes.
 - We should not copy our code - we should make functions and use them.
